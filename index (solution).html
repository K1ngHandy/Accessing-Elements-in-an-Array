    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".

       /* 
    PROBLEM 1: Create a variable that accesses the first element of the array below and print its value to the console.
    const veggies = ['carrot', 'corn', 'potato'];
    */
     
    const first = veggies[0];
    console.log(first);

    /* 
    PROBLEM 2: Create a variable that accesses the 4th element of the array below and print its value to the console.
      const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    */
    
    const fourth = numbers[3];
    console.log(fourth);

     /* 
    PROBLEM 3: Create variables that access the 5th and 6th element of the array below and print their values to the console.
      const places = ['car', 'train', 'plane', 'boat', 'moped', 'bike', 'truck', 'monorail'];
    */

    const fifth = places[4];
    const sixth = places[5];
    console.log(fifth);
    console.log(sixth);

    /* 
    PROBLEM 4: Create variables that access the 2nd, 3rd, and last elements of the array below and print their values to the console.
      const names = ['Jess', 'Jack', 'Jason', 'Jacob', 'Jennifer', 'Jacquelyn', 'Jasmyne', 'Jeanie'];
    */

    const second = names[1];
    const third = names[2];
    const last = names[7];
    console.log(second);
    console.log(third);
    console.log(last);

    /* 
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The expected output of the code below is to print out the last element in the myArray array, but when you run this code, you notice that it's printing out an 'undefined' value. Fix the code and console.log the variable to see the results printed to the console.

    const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    const lastElement = myArray[6];

    console.log(lastElement);
    */

    const lastElement = myArray[5]; //indices start at 0, so the element 6 has an index of 5
